// One feature that simplifies the data parsing and manipulation process for API responses in 
// JavaScript is the use of the fetch API along with promises and the json() method.
// Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to fetch data from an API, parse the JSON response, and then manipulate the data

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Manipulate the data here
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
  });


  // In this code snippet, the fetch function is used to make a GET request to the specified API endpoint. 
  // The .then() method is used to handle the response from the server, parse the JSON data using the json() method, and manipulate the data as needed. 
  // Any errors that occur during the fetch operation are caught using the .catch() method.
